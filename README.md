regression problem
This project focuses on solving a regression problem: estimating the coordinates of a particle as it passes through a sensor plane. Several machine learning models were trained and evaluated to predict the particleâ€™s position. The study explores the contribution of dataset features to model performance and compares predictions based on the average Euclidean distance, identifying the model that provides the most accurate position estimation.
